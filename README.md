## 🧠 Overview
This project implements a Free-Running 5D cardiac MRI reconstruction and segmentation pipeline, enabling real-time quantitative analysis directly on the MRI scanner. It was developed as part of my master’s thesis at EPFL × CHUV.
A schematic overview illustrating the server–scanner communication is available [here](./assets/fire.png) 
The main repository has not yet been published, as part of the code (IP protocol) remains under confidentiality restrictions.
